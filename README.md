Project Architecture and Structure
1. Project Overview

This project follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture pattern, which helps to separate the UI from the business logic. The project is divided into several layers, including data, domain, and presentation.

2. Modules and Layers

Data Layer: Handles data operations. It includes:

Remote Data Source: Manages API calls using Retrofit.
Local Data Source: Manages local database operations using Room.
Repository: Serves as a single source of truth, combining both remote and local data sources.
Domain Layer: Contains use cases that represent business logic.

Presentation Layer: Manages UI-related logic using ViewModel and LiveData. The UI is built with Jetpack Compose.

3. Directory Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

app/src/main/java/com/sample
├── data
│   ├── repository
│   │   └── SampleRepository.kt
│   └── source
│       ├── local
│       │   ├── ModelDao.kt
│       │   └── AppDatabase.kt
│       └── remote
│           └── ApiService.kt
├── di
│   └── AppModule.kt
├── domain
│   ├── model
│   │   └── Model.kt
│   └── usecase
│       └── FetchModelUseCase.kt
├── presentation
│   ├── view
│   │   ├── MyScreen.kt
│   │   └── NextScreen.kt
│   └── viewmodel
│       └── SampleViewModel.kt

4. Key Components

- ApiService.kt: Defines the Retrofit API service.
- ModelDao.kt: Defines the Room DAO for accessing the local database.
- AppDatabase.kt: Configures the Room database.
- SampleRepository.kt: Implements the repository pattern.
- FetchModelUseCase.kt: Contains business logic for fetching data.
- SampleViewModel.kt: Manages UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.
- MyScreen.kt: Composable function for the main screen.
- NextScreen.kt: Composable function for the next screen.
- AppModule.kt: Provides dependency injection setup using Hilt.

5. Dependency Management
   Dependencies are managed using Gradle Kotlin DSL and libs.versions.toml for library versions.
6. Navigation Setup
7. Testing
   Unit Testing
For unit testing ViewModels and other classes, use JUnit and Mockito. Place unit tests under app/src/test/java/com/sample.
UI Testing
For UI testing, use Espresso and Compose testing libraries. Place UI tests under app/src/androidTest/java/com/sample.
